                <p class="mb-4">You're making a great decision by choosing to learn how to code. As part of your course, you'll need to set up a GitHub account. Why, you ask? Well, GitHub is an essential tool used by millions of developers around the globe. It's where you'll store your code projects, collaborate with other learners, and even contribute to open-source projects later on.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Here's a simple, step-by-step guide to help you sign up for GitHub:</h3>

                <ol class="list-decimal pl-5">
